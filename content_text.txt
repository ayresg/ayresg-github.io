WORLDBUILDING QUESTIONS
- is tiered education with grad school even a thing?
- how do the guilds sustain themselves? what do the scholars do to get money?



Fun fact: the artificial river wasn't just to provide power for the dept of artificery, it was also to make the landscape more scenic for the most foolish painters in the world

Dept of Melodrama lists Despard as the Baron of the department, you have to go hunting around to find the actual dean
There's a statue of Despard, cloak billowing, holding a skull (his own). There's a sappy plaque nearby explaining who Despard was, worn nearly bare by the ravages of time, and another, nicer, plaque next to it explaining that the previous one has been worn nearly bare by the ravages of time.
Despard hasn't actually been holding a skull since it disappeared in a burst of blue flame one night; instead he now holds a small plaque explaining this. This is the third such plaque. The first two also disappeared in a burst of blue flame.

Somewhere on the website include a bulleted list of great works or inventions that the academy has produced
One of the entries is "Jeremy" with no elaboration
